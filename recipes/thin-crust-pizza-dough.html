    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li class="ingredients">1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li class="ingredients">¼ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li class="ingredients">¾ cup lukewarm water</li>
        <li class="ingredients">2 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        <li class="ingredients">½ teaspoon salt</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water that's 110 degrees F (44 degrees C) in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine 1 3/4 cups flour and salt in a large bowl. Pour in yeast mixture; mix well until dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup flour if dough is too sticky.</li>
        <li>Roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a greased pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Top crust as desired and bake at 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) until golden, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
      </ol>

    <h3>The purpose of the ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Yeast</strong>: This thin crust pizza dough starts with one teaspoon of active dry yeast.</li>
      <li><strong>Sugar and water</strong>: Activate the yeast in white sugar and lukewarm water.</li>
      <li><strong>Flour</strong>: This crispy thin crust calls for all-purpose flour instead of bread flour.</li>
      <li><strong>Salt</strong>: Salt tightens the gluten structure, which strengthens the dough and makes it more elastic.</li>
    </ul>
