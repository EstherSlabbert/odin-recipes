      Cooked beef burgers can be safely refrigerated for three to four days. Make sure to promptly chill after cooking in an airtight container to lengthen shelf life.<br />
      You can freeze cooked burger patties for up to four months. Wrap the burgers in foil individually to discourage sticking before labeling and placing them in a freezer-safe bag.
